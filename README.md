Some random unofficial plugins for [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/).

See `src/userplugins` for the plugins themselves; the rest of this repo is just Vencord with some very minor tweaks.

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/).

> [!NOTE]
> I don't recommend cloning Vencord from this repo, as I probably won't keep it super up to date

## Plugins

### PluralKitIntegration

[PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) integration, inspired by [PluralChum](https://github.com/estroBiologist/pluralchum) and [this earlier Vencord plugin](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/pull/2536/).

- Adds edit and delete buttons to proxied messages
- Replaces the annoying `APP` (formerly `BOT`) tag with `PK`
- Makes the profile popup display pronouns and description instead of just the name
- Optionally allows coloring of member names in chat by either member color, system color, or highest account role color

(see [the plugin itself](src/userplugins/pluralKitIntegration/index.tsx) for known issues and more information)

### More soon?
